# Credit Risk Case Study

## Abstract
The German credit dataset, donated by Professor Hans Hofmann via the European Statlog project and available on the [UCI Machine
Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/South+German+Credit+%28UPDATE%29), has been widely used in machine learning research. However, upon closer inspection, the dataset was found to
have many inconsistencies, rendering it unsuitable for interpretable machine learning experiments. However, upon closer inspection, the dataset was found to
have many inconsistencies, rendering it unsuitable for interpretable machine learning experiments. Nowadays we meet
lots of problems like this, so we try to create and develop new models to test the good and bad level of the credit.

## Objective
Build a model to predict the status of credit (good or bad)
